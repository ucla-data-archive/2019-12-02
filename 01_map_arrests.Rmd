## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r arrests_sum}
summary(arrest18_sf)
```

## Including Plots

Let's look at a histogram of arrest_time in our data set. 

```{r bar-graph-arrest, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(arrest18_sf, aes(x = race_cat, fill=arrest_type)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Mapping Arrests Data

Last week at the end of class we made a map of arrests by zipcode:

```{r point-data}
tm_shape(arrest18_byzip) +
   tm_polygons("n") 
```


But I had prepared the data prior to class. Let's go over how we aggregated the data in R, so we can produce the map. 

Let's look at the data first. This is all of 2018 arrests data. If you want to see how we created the dataset look in the file `data/clean.R` file in this project. 

```{r view-arrest18}
View(arrest18_sf)
```

Now, inside the `tidyverse` package we have a number of functions that let us prepare, clean, and group data. We do this by taking our dataframe and running it through a function. In R we call this process pipelining the data. Let's see how this works. The 2018 data is over 100k observations, so this takes a bit. 


```{r}
# arrests_by_zip
arrests18_zip <- arrest18_sf %>%
  count(zipcode) 
```

The resulting data frame contains 3 variables: `zipcode`, `n`, and `geometry`. 

What happened here? 

Yes, the `count()` variable takes the zipcode column and counts up the occurance by unique zipcode. It then puts this count into the `n` column, creating a count of the number of arrests by zipcode. 

We can then plot it. 
```{r}
tm_shape(arrests18_zip) +
   tm_polygons("n") 
```


The cool thing is now we have this general workflow we can create other aggregates by any number of variables. 

```{r}
arr18_bysex <- arrest18_sf %>% 
  count(sex)
```
